The explosive moment left the entire studio stunned and forced Maddow to call for security, resulting in Leavitt’s removal from the set in real time.",

Multiple commentators viewed the filing as Smith’s effort to lay out some of the evidence in advance of a trial that has been repeatedly delayed — and may never happen if Trump is re-elected and successfully directs his DOJ appointees to drop the case. The fact of the November election being only 34 days looms large over the impact this filing may potentially have.",

Advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has unveiled a colossal underground structure extending up to two kilometers deep, far beyond the visible pyramids. This discovery, published in a 2022 study, suggests that the iconic pyramids are merely the surface of a highly sophisticated, ancient engineering marvel. The findings challenge mainstream Egyptology and raise profound questions about the existence of an advanced pre-historic civilization—or even extraterrestrial intervention in Earth's history.",
